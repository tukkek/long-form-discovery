# Long-form content discovery

Directory that helps find long-form content (1- or 2-hour-long podcasts or videos), including multiple top-charts; podcasts; and You Tube videos, covering both generic and hobby topics.

The directory can be accessed here: https://tukkek.github.io/long-form-discovery/

## User-scripts
