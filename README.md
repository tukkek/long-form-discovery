# Long-form content discovery

Directory to help find long-form content (1- or 2-hour-long albums; audio-books; podcasts; and videos) including generic and hobby topics; and multiple top-charts.

The directory can be accessed here: https://tukkek.github.io/long-form-discovery/

## User-scripts

Fully-optional but convenient page-enhancers that require a user-script manager extension, such as Tamper Monkey (https://www.tampermonkey.net/).

- Pod Chaser charts: only new https://github.com/tukkek/long-form-discovery/raw/main/user-scripts/Top%20podcasts%20filter.user.js
